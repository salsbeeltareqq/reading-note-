> Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se). 



Logical Operators
(&&	 	== ===) this is the main logical operator and you can use it to make conditions with the loops and if statements.
the === operator checks the value and the type of it.
! operator called not which used to opposite the boolean and the other operator results.
loops
for loop
for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
const element = array[index];

}

used to iterate some tasks for known numbers or to iterate on arrays.

loop statment
while (condition) {
}

used to iterate some tasks for unknown times.

do while
do {

} while (condition);

used to perform tasks at least once.
