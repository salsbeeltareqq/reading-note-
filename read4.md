  What is HTML?
   HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
  HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
 HTML describes the structure of a Web page
 HTML consists of a series of elements
 HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
  HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph".


# css 
> The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element

> CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.


## exaMpLe StyLeS
* boxes 1
* text 2
* specific 3

> 
     CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.


>
   CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside  X its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look 
   
>  
    Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the  X elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

>

   Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties  X of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.


# colors
*The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in* *CSS in one of three ways:* 

1.rgb 
2.hex code 
3.color name 

## baCkground Color
body { background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}
 h1 { background-color: DarkCyan;
 } 
 h2 { background-color: #ee3e80;
 } 
 p { background-color: white;
} 


> Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
