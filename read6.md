# how computers work 
> To better imagine how a computer works, knowing what’s inside will make it easier. Here are the main components of a computer:
A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data

# hardware &software


> computer is a machine (hardware) that receives and processes data according to the instructions given to it, and after the data has been processed, the results of the processing are usually sent to an output device.

# cpu


> **A CPU is on a chip called a microprocessor (about 1 inch square in size). This is basically your Intel pentium chip. Often referred to as the brains of a computer, the CPU handles most of the operations that are required of the computer by processing instructions and sending signals out, checking for connectivity, and ensuring that operations and hardware are functioning properly. It acts as a messenger to major components such as RAM, the monitor, and disk drives**


# circuits & logic 
>
    *there is a simple circuits  turn the input from zero to 1*
   *Logic Circuits whose outputs are dependant on both their present inputs and their previous output state giving them some form of Memory. The outputs of Combinational Logic Circuits are only determined by the logical function of their current input state, logic “0” or logic “1”, at any given instant in time*
