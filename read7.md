**RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES**
* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.  1
* The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name 2
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript 3



#intrd to javascript 
*A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe*
*Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value*
*Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
JavaScript *


## how to declare function ?
function get area (width,hight){
return width*height; 
}

>when you call a function that has parameters you specify the 
values it should use in the parenthese that follow it's name 

## calling function
function name (); 
ex: sayhello();

to get single value out of a function
function calcuateArea(width*hight){
var area = width*hight ;
rutern area;
}


# notes
> JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false)

> Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

> Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
